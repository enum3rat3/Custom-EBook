# Custom E-Book Builder

## Problem Statement

What if we could design our own custom e-books by drawing chapters from multiple e-books?  
This project enables publishers to break their books into reusable components such as chapters, sections, or pages. These components can be mixed and matched by buyers to create personalized, custom e-books. Once the custom e-book is created, buyers can purchase and download it in a single compiled format.

## Features

### For Publishers:
- **Componentized Content**: Split books into modular components (chapters, sections, or pages).
- **Content Management**: A user-friendly interface to upload and manage book components.

### For Buyers:
- **Personalized E-Books**: Build custom e-books by combining components from multiple books.
- **E-Book Compilation**: Once components are selected, compile them into a single e-book format and purchase.

### For Both:
- **Easy Navigation**: Intuitive tools to browse, select, and combine content.
- **Secure E-Book Generation**: Buyers can download their custom e-books in formats like PDF.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: SpringBoot
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **E-Book Format**: PDF (or other e-book formats supported via conversion tools)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for user authentication
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 to store large book files and components.
